### Codehub bot

short commentary about this bot:
Our team has started a project named as __Codehub__.
[Codehub](http://codehub.pythonanywhere.com) is a __Django-based__ pastebin service mostly for Iranians.
Codehub on github : [Codehub](tps://github.com/lnxpy/codehub)

And I started to create an interface for this service in Iranians popular messenger (Telegram) and I ended to a Bot.
this bot is already running at [t.me/Pasterfn_bot](https://t.me/pasterfn_bot) but I will change the bot ASAP.

#### Used technologies:
